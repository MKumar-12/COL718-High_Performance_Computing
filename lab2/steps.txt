> Modify the matrix multiplication program to a blocked version.
    Used a block size of 4 over MM of 20x20



> Writing gem5 config script to simulate the program under different branch prediction schemes.
    >>  ./gem5.opt branch_pred.py -c mm_blocked.1

    Used Simulation parameters:
    (fixed mem. & clock speed) @ DDR4_2400_8x8, 2GHz

    CPU models used :   DerivO3CPU, TimingSimpleCPU

    Branch Predictions methods used :   BiModeBP, LocalBP, TAGE, TournamentBP 



> Collecting branch prediction statistics using the script for each CPU model and branch prediction methodology.
